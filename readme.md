On September 1, 2016, Cole went on exchange to Brazil. This is his story.

## Instructions
Alternate between pressing F and J to advance forward (it's harder than it sounds!)

The game becomes more difficult as you progress.

## Installation
Windows:
1. Run CCAIB.exe

Everything Else (Requires JRE):
1. Navigate to the project directory with `cd /PATHTO/CCAIB`
2. Run `java -jar ./CCAIB.jar`

## Notes
This game was made for an end of term project in high school, I've since learned a lot more and gotten better. Please take this as a snapshot of my programming skills in 2017~. Huge appreciation to Cole for the inspiration and for letting me post this recently uncovered hidden gem.

The sequel in the Crazy Cole series (Crazy Cole's Adventures in Kingston Park) is unfortunately lost to time.
